#### Hi! My name is Jon😁

I'm a Cybersecurity Diploma graduate with one year experience as an Associate Security Consultant. As an aspiring pentester who believes in learning through practicing, I’m always eager to gain new experiences and learn new skills and techniques in Pentesting/Red Teaming. I use this blog site to share my own information technology/security research and pentesting resources to contribute to the cybersecurity/IT community. Hope you find the information here useful!
