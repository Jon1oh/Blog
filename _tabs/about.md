### Hi! My name is Jon😁

I'm a Cybersecurity Diploma graduate with one year experience as an Associate Security Consultant. As an aspiring pentester who believes in learning through practicing, I’m always open to gain new experiences and eager to challenge myself to learn new skills and techniques in Pentesting/Red Teaming (especially Active Directory!) I created this blog site to share my own security research and pentesting resources to contribute to the cybersecurity community.
